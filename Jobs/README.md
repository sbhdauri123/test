## Overview

<!-- 

This is still just a placeholder for showing the intention of writing documentation about the best practices we should follow for the different job types we have.

For example:
- How queues work
- What is a queue item
- What are unfinished jobs.
- Which jobs should handle unfinished jobs.
- Retry logic.
- Throttling.
- Batch requests.
- Sync/Async APIs.
- How to test existing and new data sources
